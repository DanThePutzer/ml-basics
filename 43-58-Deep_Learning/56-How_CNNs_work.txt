State of the art in image recognition

Structure:
  Input -> Convolution -> Pooling -> Convolution -> Pooling -> Fully Connected Layer -> Output
           |-- Hidden Layer 1 --|    |-- Hidden Layer 2 --|

What a Convolution does:
  - Looks at picture as a matrix of pixels
  - Slides an nxn (e.g. 3x3) filter over image, each cell in filter has weight just like neuron connections in regular neural network
  - Filter multiplies value of image pixels with filter weights and then takes dot product of filter matrix to get one single value
  - Repeat above steps until entire image is covered
    -> Stride: Determines how many pixels filter gets moved each step

  Result: New image reduced in size

What Pooling does:
  - Looks at newly generated matrix from Convolution
  - Uses filter like Convolution and slides over matrix
  - Depending on Pooling method, takes highest value from each filtering step or calculates average
  - Generates new matrix of values with results from all the Pooling steps

  Result: Further reduces image in size
