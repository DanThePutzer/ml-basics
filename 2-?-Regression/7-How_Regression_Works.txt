Tries to find line that best approximates the data
Works fairly well or not depending on how linear the relationship between the data points is

y = mx + b

m: Slope of line

       (mean(x) * mean(y) - mean(x * y))
  m =  ---------------------------------
          mean(x)^2 - mean(x^2)


b: Intercept on y-axis

  b = mean(y) - m * mean(x)
