- - - - How To Calculate Accuracy For LR - - - -

The error is distance from point to regression line
  -> Error can be positive or negative
All errors will be squared so we only have to deal with positive values
Squaring errors also penalizes outliers by increasing their error value even further

Coefficient of Determination:
- Basically comparing mean(y) line (which is a straight line) to the Regression Line

              SE * y_hat
  r**2 = 1 - -------------
              SE * mean(y)

- SE: Sum of all Squared Errors
- y_hat: y-coordinates of Regression (aka Best Fit) Line
- mean(y): Mean of y-coordinates of training dataset

Interpreting r**2 Value:
- The higher r**2 the better the regression line fit and/or the more linear the data
  EXP:
      r**2 = 0.8 --> SE*y_hat = 2     --> Big difference between y_hat error and mean(y) error
                     SE*mean(y) = 10
                    

- The lower r**2 the worse the regression line fit and/or the less linear the data
  EXP:
      r**2 = 0.3 --> SE*y_hat = 7     --> Little difference between y_hat error and mean(y) error
                     SE*mean(y) = 10
