- - - - SVM with not linearly separable data - - - -

SVM can only separate 2 groups of data at a time
There's 2 major ways to handle datasets with more than 2 groups:
  • OVR: One Vs. Rest
    -> For each group tries to separate from the rest and draws a new hyperplane for each
    -> Is default method
  • OVO: One Vs. One
    -> Tries to separate selected group from each other group individually (1 from 2, 1 from 3, 2 from 1, 2 from 3, etc.)
