Hierarchical clustering -> Algrithm figures out how many clusters exist

Initially every single point is a cluster center
Each cluster center has a radius and a bandwidth
• Bandwith: Circle around the cluster center
• Radius: Distance from cluster center to bandwidth

Radius determines Bandwith
For every cluster center (aka. datapoint):
  - Find other points within bandwith
  - Calculate mean of points within bandwidth -> new cluster center
  - Continue until cluster center doesn't move anymore

  -> When cluster centers of neighboring points reach same position -> Convergence
