First dive into unsupervised learning
K Means is a clustering algorithm
  - Algorithm will try to separate data into to K clusters

K = 2 -> Flat Clustering
How it works:
  - Randomly choose K datapoints -> centeroids
  - Calculate euclidian distance between remaining datapoints and centeroids
    -> Each datapoint will get class of centeroid closest to it -> Forming of clusters
  - Once all datapoints are classified -> Calculate mean for each cluster
  - Mean of each cluster becomes new centeroid -> All datapoints get reclassified according to new centeroids
  - Repeat until centeroids don't move anymore

Often has tolerance parameter to allow for some error and a maximum iterations parameter so it doesn't take forever

Since K Means adheres to distance it doesn't work well when one is looking for clusters of different sizes
