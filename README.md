**TARS (Totally Awesome Robot Servant)** - Artificially intelligent robot from Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar***

A journey into the land of artificial intelligence and machine learning, covering all sorts of algorithms and concepts. This repo contains work done with popular packages and libraries like SciKit-Learn and Tensorflow as well implementing popular machine learning algorithms from scratch.

Based on an extensive YouTube tutorial series by the one and only [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v).
