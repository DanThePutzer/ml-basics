(Instance Based Learning)

Used to classify data (Exp. clustering)
Looks for k other closest datapoints and how they were classified
  -> Will assign class based on class of majority of closest datapoints

K should be a non-even number otherwise split votes might happen

- Confidence: How sure the model is about its classification
    Exp: --+ = 66% confident it is a -
- Accuracy: How well the model classifies in general

For Linear Regression Confidence and Accuracy are pretty much the same

Major downfall: Have to calculate Euclidian distance for all datapoints to find closest k
  -> Becomes less and less efficient the bigger the dataset
